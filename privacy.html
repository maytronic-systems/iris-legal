<h2>2. General Information</h2>
<p>
The app <strong>IRIS – Insight & Recon Interface System</strong> provides analysis and visualization of
system-related information on Android devices, including app activity, permissions, and network statistics.
</p>
<p>
All data processing is performed <strong>exclusively locally on the user’s device</strong>.
No personal data is transmitted to external servers.
</p>
<p>
IRIS does not create user profiles, does not track users, and does not collect personal content,
location data, or communication data.
</p>

<h2>3. Types of Data Processed</h2>
<p>
Depending on the enabled features, IRIS may process the following data locally on the device:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>List of installed applications</li>
  <li>Application names, package names, and icons</li>
  <li>Granted application permissions</li>
  <li>Application usage statistics (foreground and background activity)</li>
  <li>Aggregated network traffic data (upload and download volumes)</li>
  <li>User-defined rules, alerts, and configuration settings</li>
</ul>
<p>
All data remains stored exclusively on the user’s device.
</p>

<h2>4. Android Permissions</h2>

<h3>a) Usage Access (PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS)</h3>
<p>
Required to display application usage duration, foreground/background activity,
and activity timelines.
</p>

<h3>b) Network Statistics Access</h3>
<p>
Required to display application-level network traffic and aggregated data usage.
</p>

<h3>c) Installed Applications Access</h3>
<p>
Required to identify installed applications and analyze permissions and metadata.
</p>

<h3>d) Notifications (optional)</h3>
<p>
Used exclusively for event-based notifications triggered by user-defined rules
(e.g. configured alerts in the Action Center).
</p>

<h2>5. Purpose of Data Processing</h2>
<p>
Data processing is carried out solely for the following purposes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Analysis and visualization of application activity</li>
  <li>Display of system and usage statistics</li>
  <li>Transparency regarding application permissions</li>
  <li>Event-based notifications according to user configuration</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Legal Basis</h2>
<p>
Data processing is based on the following legal grounds:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Article 6(1)(b) GDPR – performance of the app’s functionality</li>
  <li>Article 6(1)(a) GDPR – user consent by granting system permissions</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Data Storage and Deletion</h2>
<p>
All data is stored locally on the user’s device.
No cloud synchronization or external storage is used.
</p>
<p>
All stored data is deleted when the app is uninstalled.
</p>

<h2>8. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
No personal data is shared with third parties.
</p>

<h2>9. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
IRIS does not use external analytics, tracking, or advertising services.
</p>
<p>
If in-app purchases are offered, payment processing is handled exclusively
by the Google Play Store in accordance with Google’s privacy policies.
</p>

<h2>10. User Rights</h2>
<p>
Users have the right to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Access their data</li>
  <li>Request correction or deletion</li>
  <li>Restrict processing</li>
  <li>Withdraw consent at any time</li>
</ul>
<p>
Since all data is stored locally, these rights can be exercised directly
through the app or by uninstalling it.
</p>

<h2>11. Supervisory Authority</h2>
<p>
Users may lodge a complaint with a competent data protection supervisory authority.
</p>

<h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
